title: About
excerpt: Our Raleigh Food Not Bombs (FNB) chapter, is an autonomous collective that provides food to wherever it is needed in the community.
locale: en-US
priority: 1
---
We collect donated items from members of the community, local groceries and food outlets.

We distribute these donations in three main ways; free package delivery, free cooked meals, and free grocery distribution in downtown Raleigh

We believe that homelessness and food insecurity in general is inherently caused by capitalism, racism, and local gentrification.

In a culture devoted to profit, we, without restriction, share food, time and compassion with no expectations. We are not a charity, but mutual aid, striving to stand against the injustices pushed upon our community. We advocate/provide healthy food options, provide educational resources and indiscriminately share support.

In society that wastes so much, Food is a right, not a privilege, we have plenty to share.

## Why

Raleigh has food deserts, which means that there is not enough produce for the people who live in that area.

Raleighâ€™s leadership donors are real-estate developers. Interests are misaligned and only serve the needs of capitalists and the wealthy.

## Our Progress

Since July, our distro downtown has served over 100 people every week, over 100 hot meals are cooked. And during those 6 months of 2020 we have made over 600 home deliveries to residents in the area. Since October 2020 we've fulfilled (in addition) over 300 requests for clothing needs for hundreds of community members.
